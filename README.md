# Challlenge 02: Advanced CSS Portfolio

## README

### Description

Creating any website from scratch -- even a single webpage -- can be an intimidating and overwhelming undertaking. After only two weeks of classes to cram in both advanced HTML and CSS learning, we had plenty of online resources and notes to draw from but limited applied experience. Growing up in the 1990s as a teenage computer nerd, I taught myself a (much) earlier version of HTML that existed at the time, back in the days of AOL dial-up and before "Java" became the most popular internet word for a generation. 

My previous experience with HTML both helped and hindered my efforts in this week's challenge. On the one hand, having revisited basic HTML programming over the years since I was a kid and so thus possessing some measure of "muscle memory" when it comes to the overall structure and feel of putting an HTML website together, I have a mental grab-bag of HTML and CSS tags, styles, elements, and so forth in my mind to draw from when stuck on a problem or even just trying to generate a working line of website code. 

On the other hand, I found myself relying on some possibly outdated or at least non-best-practice elements, styles, etc., as habitual from earlier experiences using more primitive code. I attempted to limit these non-ideal formulations and stick with what we had been taught combined with the most recent reference documentation available online.

I also made use of code fragments that were part of our activities from the first two weeks of the Boot Camp, adjusting terms, variables, elements, etc. as I went along and saw how the pieces fit together in the HTML file, the CSS stylesheet, and ultimately what appeared in my browser when previewing the website in Chrome from VS Code.

I made use of a much more colorful and bold aesthetic than I would likely use in a truly finished portfolio (or any website) in order to practice different styles and experiment with them, as they were changed and moved within and between the HTML and CSS files.

In terms of content, I decided to highlight my actual career achievements and skills, rather than come up with imaginary web and app development projects that I haven't yet accomplished. My audio and video production experiences with MODIBA and my podcast/production company The BizzleCast are all real life experiences. The B|Cast Workshop moniker comes from an unpublished website that is the most recent formulation of my skills and experience as channeled into an updated consulting company profiled.

What I mostly learned from this particular endeavor -- in addition to improving my skills and further internalizing modern HTML and CSS terminology and execution -- was something I've always known about myself, which is that I'm a pretty bad artist but a decent organizer of information. Somewhat more importantly, my overall understanding of how websites are constructed and imagined in 2023 has already far surpassed the fairly beginner to intermediate skills I possessed in earlier phases of my life when I experimented with and used HTML to varying degrees.

I'm sure I have plenty more to say, but I have some additional comments in the HTML and CSS files on more specific code-related notes.
